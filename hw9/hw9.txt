1)
It looks like the input layer is a two-demensional array of size 28x28.
This most likely represents the pixels of each image.

The next layer is a set of neurons that has 28*28=784 inputs and 512 outputs.

The next layer is a set of neurons that has 512 inputs and 128 outpus.

The next layer is a set of neurons that has 128 inputs and 10 outputs

The Final layer is the the 10 outputs of the last neuron layer.

2)
The activation function is ReLU or g(x) = max(0, x)

3)
96%

4)
91%

5)
Yes it went down 5% because there wasn't as many neurons to be as precise

6)
10:   56%
100:  83%
200:  88%
300:  91%
400:  92%
500:  93%
600:  93%
700:  92%
800:  94%
1000: 95%

Yes as more iterations happen, the training becomes more and more accurate
thus trending to upper 90%
